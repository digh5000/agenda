+ http://dhcu.ca/2015/assignment-join-the-crowd

You might find it useful to read ['The Wikiblitz'](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/12230987.0001.001/1:5/--writing-history-in-the-digital-age?g=dculture;rgn=div1;view=fulltext;xc=1) first.
(See also where I [mapped Wikipedia](http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue39/1/toc.html)). MAKE SURE YOU USE A PSEUDONYMN. If you simply 'edit' without having a login, Wikipedia will record your IP address, which may not be something you want to have happen. Also, make sure you learn some of the conventions of wikipedia editing (markup etc). You should start with small edits first to see what happens.

Part of the point of this assignment is to observe how knowledge is created via this, that most successful of crowdsourced projects. Keep notes. Your assignment is 'submitted' by commenting on the DHCU.ca post.
